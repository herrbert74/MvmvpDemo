I wanted to learn from this application (especially ViewModel in MVP, but also Kotlin and RxJava testing), but some problems prohibited the understanding of it, so I fixed them by rewriting the app step by step:
* Separated the 'branches' like basic, RX, VM to branches
* Simplified overly complicated names according to my own naming rules. Also removed lower case file names
* Fixed a bug in the tests
* Converted space-tabs to tabs, because this is now mine, so hey, my rules apply
* Omitted data binding as I'm not interested in it at this time
* Removed a few Lint warnings
